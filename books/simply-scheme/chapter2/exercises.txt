2.2:
 The domain of the "vowel?" function is composed of every kind of type 
 presented in the book so far. Its domain is always a boolean type
 indicating if the argument is a vowel or not.

2.3:
 The domain of the "appearances" function might be a char, word or a
 positive number. The range is composed of numbers (from 0 to n). The
 function's purpose is to find occurrences of the first argument into
 the second one, so if the letter c is passed to be found in the word
 coala, the result will be 1, because there's only one occurrence.

2.4:
 The "item" function is used to get a value at the specified index.
 It takes two arguments: the first is a positive number (the index), 
 and the second might be a word, sentence, or number,
 which is interpreted as a sequence. The range is the value at
 specified index.

 even?, number?, odd?, vowel?
